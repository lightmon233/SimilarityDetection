## ⚙️ **How to Deploy the Web Application**

To deploy the web application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:

    Run the following command in the frontend directory to install necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the Vue Development Server**:

    After the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend server:

    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```

    This will start the Vue.js development server on your local machine.

3. **Build the Backend (Spring Boot)**:

    Now, move to the backend directory and build the Spring Boot application:

    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```

4. **Run the Spring Boot Application**:

    Once the application is built, you can run the backend server with the following command:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    Your backend server will now be running on your local machine!
